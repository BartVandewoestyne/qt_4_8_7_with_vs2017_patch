# An attempt to build Qt 4.8.7 with Visual Studio 2017
This patch is my attempt to build Qt 4.8.7 with Visual Studio 2017.  It is currently in an unfinished state and not working yet, thus still work in progress.

Remaining questions:
  * The first step is to rebuild the configure tool with support for Visual Studio 2017.  However, it is not completely clear to me how I can do that.  Any help appreciated here.
